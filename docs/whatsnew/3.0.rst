.. _whatsnew-3.0-map-plotting:

Improvements to Visualization of Maps
=====================================

.. minigallery:: sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_quadrangle


.. _whatsnew-3.0-map-eui:

Improved Support for Solar Orbiter's EUI Instrument in Map
==========================================================

A new map source to support data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument on the Solar Orbiter (SolO) spacecraft has been added.
This source improves the accuracy of the observer position by using the heliocentric inertial coordinates as well as correctly setting the processing level, exposure time and colormap.
Data from EUI will automatically load using this source via `sunpy.map.Map`.

.. _whatsnew-3.0-map-metadata:

Inspect History of Metadata changes in Map
==========================================

The ``.meta`` property of a map now keeps a record of the contents of the metadata (normally a FITS header) when it was created.
This can be accessed via the `~sunpy.util.metadata.MetaDict.original_meta` property.
This allows any changes made by sunpy or by the user directly to be tracked with the following properties:

  * `~sunpy.util.metadata.MetaDict.added_items`
  * `~sunpy.util.metadata.MetaDict.removed_items`
  * `~sunpy.util.metadata.MetaDict.modified_items`

See the new :ref:`sphx-glr-generated-gallery-map-map-metadata-modification-py` example for details.
