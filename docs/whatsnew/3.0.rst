.. _whatsnew-3.0-map-plotting:

Improvements to Visualization of Maps
=====================================

In this release a number of methods on Maps for visualising maps have been improved to be more coordinate aware than in previous releases.
The first new feature is the `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_quadrangle` method which replaces the old ``draw_rectangle`` method.
`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_quadrangle` draws rectangles where the edges follow the lines of constant longitude and latitude in the coordinate system in which the box is drawn.

.. minigallery:: sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_quadrangle

The next change is to the `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_limb` method, which now supports drawing the limb as seen by any observer on any image.
This means that it is possible to visualize the sections of the limb which are visible in one image on another, or to draw the limb as seen from a specified observer on a synoptic map.

.. minigallery:: sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_limb

Finally, the last major change is to the `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.plot` method, which now supports an ``autoalign=True`` keyword argument.
This option when set to `True` will use `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh` to transform the image being plotted on an unaligned axes to the correct coordinates.
This allows for plots of two images with different projections or WCSes to be visualized together correctly.
It is worth noting that using ``autoalign=True`` is computationally expensive, so when using with interactive plots there is a significant performance penalty.

See the :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_gallery_map_transformations_autoalign_aia_hmi.py` example for details.

.. _whatsnew-3.0-map-eui:

Improved Support for Solar Orbiter's EUI Instrument in Map
==========================================================

A new map source to support data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument on the Solar Orbiter (SolO) spacecraft has been added.
This source improves the accuracy of the observer position by using the heliocentric inertial coordinates as well as correctly setting the processing level, exposure time and colormap.
Data from EUI will automatically load using this source via `sunpy.map.Map`.

.. _whatsnew-3.0-map-metadata:

Inspect History of Metadata changes in Map
==========================================

The ``.meta`` property of a map now keeps a record of the contents of the metadata (normally a FITS header) when it was created.
This can be accessed via the `~sunpy.util.metadata.MetaDict.original_meta` property.
This allows any changes made by sunpy or by the user directly to be tracked with the following properties:

* `~sunpy.util.metadata.MetaDict.added_items`
* `~sunpy.util.metadata.MetaDict.removed_items`
* `~sunpy.util.metadata.MetaDict.modified_items`

See the new :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_gallery_map_map_metadata_modification.py` example for details.

.. _whatsnew-3.0-instr:

``sunpy.instr`` Moved to ``sunkit-instruments``
===============================================

The `sunpy.instr` subpackage has been moved to a separate affiliated package called `sunkit-instruments <https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/sunkit-instruments/>`__.
This has been done to make the core package align with the goal that instrument specific analysis and processing code should live in affiliated packages.

.. _whatsnew-3.0-python:
