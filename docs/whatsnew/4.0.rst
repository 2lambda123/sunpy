Increase in required package versions
=====================================
We have bumped the minimum version of several packages we depend on; these are the new minimum versions:

- python >= 3.8

Improved return types of HEK queries
====================================
The 'event_endtime', 'event_starttime' and 'event_peaktime' columns in a HEK
query are now returned as `~astropy.time.Time` objects.

Better printing of metadata
===========================
Printing a `.MetaDict` now prints each entry on a new line, making it much easier to read::

  >>> from sunpy.data.sample import AIA_171_IMAGE  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
  >>> from sunpy.map import Map
  >>> m = Map(AIA_171_IMAGE)  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
  >>> print(m.meta)  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
  simple: True
  bitpix: -32
  naxis: 2
  naxis1: 1024
  naxis2: 1024
  ...
