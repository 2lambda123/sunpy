Welcome to the guide for the ``sunpy`` core package.

What is this?
-------------
This guide provides a set of in-depth explanations for various parts of the sunpy core package.
It assumes you have some knowledge of what sunpy is and how it works - if you're starting fresh you might want to check out the :ref:`tutorial` first.

How to use this guide
---------------------
The guide is designed to be read in a standalone manner, without running any code at the same time.
Although there are code snippets in various bits of the guide, these are to help explanation, and are not structured in a way that they can be run as you're reading the guide.
