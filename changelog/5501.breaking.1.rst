`sunpy.map.GenericMap.wcs` no longer passes the whole ``.meta`` dictionary to
`astropy.wcs.WCS` when constructing ``.wcs``. Instead each metadata value is
manually taken from various map properties, which allows fixes to be made to
the WCS without modifying the original map header. We think that
`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.wcs` correctly sets all the keys needed for a full WCS
header, but if you find anything missing please open an issue on the sunpy
issue tracker.
