Added the :meth:`~sunpy.net.base_client.QueryResponseTable.total_size`, which
estimates the total size of the results from a Fido query. If this is supported
by a client, the total size is printed alongside the results.

To add support for this in external clients, make sure one column contains
the individual filesizes as `~astropy.units.Quantity`, and set the
``size_column`` class attribute to the name of this column.
