The `sunpy.visualization.animator` subpackge has been spun out into the
standalone `mpl-animators <https://pypi.org/project/mpl-animators>`_ package,
with the exception of `~sunpy.visualization.animator.MapSequenceAnimator`.
Please update your imports to replace ``sunpy.visualization.animator`` with
``mpl_animators``.

This is primarily because the ``ndcube`` package now relies on the animator
classes as well as `sunpy`.
