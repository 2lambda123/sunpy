The ``sunpy.net.helioviewer`` module is deprecated and will be removed in version 5.1.
The Helioviewer Project now maintains a replacement Python library called `hvpy <https://hvpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
As such, in consultation with the Helioviewer Project, we have decided to deprecate the ``HelioviewerClient`` class.
