In `sunpy.map.GenericMap.coordinate_system` and `sunpy.map.GenericMap.date`, the default values
will now be used if the expected key(s) used to derive those properties are empty.
Previously, empty values of these keys were not treated as missing and thus the default values
were not correctly filled in.
