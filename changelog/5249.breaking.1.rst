Deprecated `sunpy.roi.chaincode.Chaincode` and created a replacement at `sunpy.net.helio.Chaincode`.

This replacement has the following changes:

1. Added support for numpy array as an input (it was broken before).
1. Renamed BoundingBox to boundingbox
2. Renamed subBoundingBox to sub_boundingbox
2. Now area and length raise NotImplemented
