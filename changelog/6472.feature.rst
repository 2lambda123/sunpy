`sunpy.net.Scraper` now includes treats files as spanning a full interval equal to the smallest increment specified in the file pattern.
For example, a pattern like ``"%Y.txt"`` that only contains a year specifier will be considered to span that full year.

This means searches that fall entirely within the whole interval spanned by a pattern will return that file, where previously they did not.
As an example, matching ``"%Y.txt"`` with ``TimeRange('2022-02-01', '2022-04-01')`` will now return ``["2022.txt"]`` where previously no files were returned.
