`sunpy.image.transform.affine_transform` and :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.rotate`
have both had their ``use_scipy`` arguments deprecated. Instead use the new
``method`` argument, which can currently be set to either ``'skimage'``
(the default) or ``'scipy'``. In the future we hope to use this new argument
to support generic user supplied transformation functions.
